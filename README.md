# CyberSafe üõ°Ô∏è

I built CyberSafe as a secure web application designed to serve as a Student Cybersecurity Sharing Platform. It enables users ‚Äî especially students ‚Äî to register, log in, participate in forum discussions, and share valuable cybersecurity resources. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Authentication is handled securely with JWT tokens, and passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

## Features

- User Registration & Login
- JWT Authentication
